# astroPaper
If you are a bit like me, you certainly waste a lot of time choosing the right wallpaper for your desktop, preferably a picture of Andromeda galaxy or NGC 281.
AstroPaper is basically a Python script wrapped in nice and sleek Electron.js GUI, serving random pictures from NASA's Astronomy Picture of The Day (http://apod.nasa.gov/)
